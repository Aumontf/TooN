<H3>Intro</H3>
<br>
This is the documentation for my simple C++ numerics libarary.
<br><br>
The library is currently just a set of C++ header files which provide basic numerics
facilities (vectors, matrices and some matrix decompositions).  It provides
classes for statically (known at compile time) and dynamically (unknown at compile time)
sized vectors and  matrices and it delegates advanced functions (like SVD or multiplication
of large matrices) to  LAPACK and BLAS (this means you will need libblas and liblapack).
<br><br>
The library makes substantial internal use of templates to achieve 
run-time speed efficiency whilst retaining a (reasonably) clear
programming syntax.  Because of this use of templates, you will need
a recent compiler (for example it does not work with g++ before version 3.0).
Programs that use it can also take a *long* time to compile with -O3 under g++.
<br><br>
Currently the library only supports double precision vectors and matrices.
I plan to support single precision as well as single and
double precision complex numbers in future versions.
<br><br>
The library is released under the LGPL (see license.txt and the preamble on each header file).  This
is version 0.1 and is an alpha release and probably liable to failure.  Any bugfixes,
requests for new features or code for new features can be emailed to me (twd20@eng.cam.ac.uk).


<H3>Why use this library?</H3>
1) because it supports statically sized vectors and matrices very efficiently
(without introducing metadata)*
<br>
2) because it provides type safety for statically sized vectors and matrices
(you can't attempt to multiply a 3x4 matrix and a 2-vector).
<br>
3) because it supports transposition and subscripting of matrices (to obtain a vector)
very efficiently
<br>
4) because it exploits LAPACK and BLAS (for which optimised versions exist on many platforms).
<br>
<br>
(*) This is not always true (see <A HREF="implementation.html">Implementation</A>)
