You're on the completely broken development branch of TooN 2.0, and it WILL NOT
WORK. If you want a working TooN version, then run, get it using:

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/cvsroot/toon \
         co -r Maintenance_Branch_1_x TooN

or update what you currently have using:

cvs up -r Maintenance_Branch_1_x

or head over to:

http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~er258/cvd/

and get the latest snapshot.
